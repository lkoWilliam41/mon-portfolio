					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this. My mom passed away 5 years ago and my dad has dementia. These holidays are always a little off for me now, to the point that I don‚Äôt want to celebrate them. Oddly enough, Mother‚Äôs Day is easier because everyone knows about my mom, but Father‚Äôs Day‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Father‚Äôs Day is just hard. He doesn‚Äôt know what day it is, so it‚Äôs hard to acknowledge it. But then I feel like a bad daughter‚Ä¶. ugh. So thanks. This will help. (c)]]></description>
