					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this. My mom passed away 5 years ago and my dad has dementia. These holidays are always a little off for me now, to the point that I don’t want to celebrate them. Oddly enough, Mother’s Day is easier because everyone knows about my mom, but Father’s Day…… Father’s Day is just hard. He doesn’t know what day it is, so it’s hard to acknowledge it. But then I feel like a bad daughter…. ugh. So thanks. This will help. (c)]]></description>
