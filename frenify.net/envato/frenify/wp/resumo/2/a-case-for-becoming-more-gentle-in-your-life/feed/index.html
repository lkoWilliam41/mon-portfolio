					<description><![CDATA[Oh this article and CJ’s comment… wow. It’s been two years since I broke off an eight year relationship and it was the hardest and best decision I have ever made. I could go on and on but Everything in this article and in CJ’s comment is spot on. Cheers. (c)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your story resonates so much here… Two years ago I broke up with the love of my life after more than 13 years together (yep… from age 17 til 30) and looking back I can’t believe the journey and change I’ve been through ever since. It’s been a true roller coaster ride, with euphoric and often very impulsive ups and deep, deep downs, but it’s been worth it. With baby steps, I discovered (and am still discovering) a new me, a real me, a grown up me, confident and free spirited. I’ve often felt frustrated about how long it took me to feel a bit balanced again after the total disruption and unraveling of my life as I had known it, but I now know I needed that time. There is no manual, there is just you, your intuition and the love, energy and support of the true friends you surround yourself with to take this adventure. (c)]]></description>
